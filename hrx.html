<h1>Planets</h1>
  
    <h3>Sun</h3>
    <img src="https://imgs.search.brave.com/CsEqTGV2ZKWuhnmjIMAfESFZtYW35tLqo0AfYjbGYIU/rs:fit:860:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4u/dmVjdG9yc3RvY2su/Y29tL2kvcHJldmll/dy0xeC84My84My9s/b2dvLWZvci1zdW4t/dmVjdG9yLTQ3MjU4/MzgzLmpwZw" alt="sun">
    <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive hot ball of plasma,[18][19] inflated and heated by nuclear fusion reactions at its core. Part of this internal energy is emited from the Sun's surface as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, providing most of the energy for life on Earth.

      The Sun's radius is about 695,000 kilometers (432,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, comprising about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.[20] Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.[21]</p>
    <h3>Mercury</h3>

    <p>Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System. It is a terrestrial planet with a heavily cratered surface due to the planet having no geological activity and an extremely tenuous atmosphere (called an exosphere). Despite being the smallest planet in the Solar System with a mean diameter of 4,880 km (3,030 mi), 38% of that of Earth's, Mercury is dense enough to have roughly the same surface gravity as Mars.</p>
  
    <h3>Venus</h3>

    <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet with the densest atmosphere of all the rocky bodies in the Solar System, and the only one with a mass and size that is close to that of its orbital neighbour Earth. Orbiting inferiorly (inside of Earth's orbit), it appears in Earth's sky always close to the Sun, as either a "morning star" or an "evening star". While this is also true for Mercury, Venus appears much more prominently, since it is the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the Moon and the Sun,[20][21] appearing brighter than any other star-like classical planet or any fixed star. With such a prominence in Earth's sky, Venus has historically been a common and important object for humans, in both their cultures and astronomy.</p>
 
  
 
    <h3>Earth</h3>

    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's surface. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water together. Earth's land is part of Earth's crust, consisting of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Inside Earth's crust is a liquid outer core that generates the magnetosphere, deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation..</p>
  
  
 
    <h3>Mars</h3>
    <img src="https://imgs.search.brave.com/uLa4f0f4tiyJmc6Sg0y-4xWwioK_HG2w1GeP8BqcELo/rs:fit:860:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly90My5m/dGNkbi5uZXQvanBn/LzAxLzI3Lzg1LzQ4/LzM2MF9GXzEyNzg1/NDg1OF9PdllnaUJZ/TU9SclFZM3V2UE81/MG5Xek9wSTBJVDFL/aC5qcGc" alt="mars">
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet and the furthest terrestrial planet from the Sun. The reddish color of its surface is due to finely grained iron(III) oxide dust in the soil, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet".[21][22] Mars's radius is second smallest among the planets in the Solar System at 3,389.5 km (2,106 mi). The Martian dichotomy is visible on the surface: on average, the terrain on Mars's northern hemisphere is flatter and lower than its southern hemisphere. Mars has a thin atmosphere made primarily of carbon dioxide and two irregularly shaped natural satellites: Phobos and Deimos.</p>
